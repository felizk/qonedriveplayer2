# OneDrive Player (qonedriveplayer2)

This is a little project I've setup to connect to Microsoft Graph using MSAL.

It's a Quasar app that uses composition-api and Vue 2.

I mostly put it here so someone else may copy and paste it.

I am by no means an expert in any of this... 

I just followed the Quasar dev instructions, added the Microsoft class and injected into a few components.

Features:

 * Login via MSAL
 * Fetch user from Microsoft Graph
 * Navigation Guard that puts you to the login screen if not logged in
 * Composition api use to inject instance of the Microsoft objects.
